# Deep Bounding Box Regression using Keras

A Keras model to infer bounding box coordinates of synthetic black images with white boxes

## Getting Started

- Clone the repo into your folder

    `git clone https://github.com/sanjeev309/deep_bbox_regression_keras.git`

- Launch `jupyter notebook` in the repo directory and open the notebook `keras_bbox_regression.ipynb`


## Prerequisites

Keras, Matplotlib, OpenCV 3.2

## Summary

Deep Models are good for tasks of classification. However they can also be utilised to solve regression problems.

Using Deep regression, a CNN model with Dense end nodes can be utilised to predict the 4 coordinates

of a bounding box namely (x1,y1) and (x2,y2)

For example:

Given the input image (100 * 100):

The model predicts the bounding box coordinates :

`[0.37, 0.31, 0.91, 0.81]`

which when rescaled to the image corresponds to 

`[37, 31, 91, 81]`
